Appium design:
 Webdriver Script
 (Appium uses Selenium's webdriver library, that's why Appium supports all the languages that Selenium does)
 (Write scripts using the webdriver library. After this, the webdriver / JSON wire protocol is used to convert your scripts into HTTP REST based requests that can be understood by the Appium server)
 (Appium server runs requests and runs automation using the native automation framework of that particular mobile device)
 (Appium interacts with the automation framework of that mobile device and uses it to run your script and perform automation on that app)
 Appium server establishes connection with Appium client (your webdriver script)
